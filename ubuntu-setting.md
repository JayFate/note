Default behavior of Left Super on English US is mapped to Gnome Desktop Dashboard. 
Tweak tool had all the necessary settings in an easy to use GUI!

```bash
sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool
```
First I swapped the dashboard hotkey to the right side and then under "Additional Layout Options" 
you can use "Ctrl position/ Swap Left Win with Left Ctrl" to good effect.
